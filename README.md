# RealEstate-Tokenizer
The RealEstateTokenizer project is a blockchain-based solution that enables the tokenization of real estate properties. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain, this project allows property owners to fractionalize their real estate assets into fungible tokens, enabling fractional ownership and liquid real estate investment.
